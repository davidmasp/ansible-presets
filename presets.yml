### other ideas that I am not sure I want to dev yet
### 1) Install anaconda/miniconda through ansible
## mkdir home/dmas/src/anaconda
## https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh
## sha256sum Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh
## then executing (it is interactive, worth it?)
### 2) download repo of curated self envs
